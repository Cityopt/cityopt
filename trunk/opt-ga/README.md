This directory contains the genetic algorithm part of the Cityopt
planning tool.  It consists mainly of the problem definition for the
[Opt4J][] framework.  To actually compute something you'll need to
configure Opt4J.  Its configuration system is built on top of [Guice][].
Classes ending in `Module` are typically Guice modules.
`CityoptModule` will handle the basic problem definition but requires
bindings for an `OptimisationProblem` and optionally a `SimulationStorage`
and an `Ã’ptimisationLog`.  You will also need to add one of the optimiser
modules from Opt4J.  If you want to read the optimisation problem from files
you can use `CityoptFileModule`.  It provides complete configuration for
`CityoptModule` so you'll only need to configure an optimiser and what
other Opt4J modules you want to add.  You can do that with the Opt4J GUI,
which `CityoptFileModule` also supports.  See `opt-runner` if you want to run
Opt4J outside web-client.

CSV I/O support is here because it was originally developed for running
Opt4J independently.  It may get moved to sim-eval at some point.  On the
other hand sim-eval does not use Guice but the I/O support does.  There is a
Guiceless facade for the I/O in `OptimisationProblemIO`, which injects
dependencies by hand.

There is also some support for logging and solution output that is primarily
intended for use with the Opt4J GUI.  It can be configured with
`CityoptOutputModule`.
