This is a Maven project for running opt-ga via Opt4J.  Unlike opt-ga, this
project includes the full Opt4J as dependencies.  Thus all features of Opt4J
are available.

A standalone jar containing all dependencies can be built with
the included launch configuration.  Do that and run the jar.  For some
reason running the project from Eclipse does not include all the dependencies.
